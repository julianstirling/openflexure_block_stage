# Docubricks Web Test

This folder uses [rwb27's fork of the Docubricks Viewer](https://github.com/rwb27/docubricksViewer/) to view the documentation in this repository.  You can either see the [current master version](./current_master_version.html) or use the [url form](./docubricks-viewer-pasteurl.html) if you want to load a specific version.

The files in this folder are everything you need in order to view DocuBricks projects (though they do reference a few libraries online).  The files in node_modules will be eliminated at some point...
